This project was in collaboration with Daphne Kallinderi and Kiera Patterson as part of the 
PhD-Level Optimization Methods course at MIT (6.C57/15.C57). In this project, we tackled the problem of 
assigning women's swimmers at MIT to correct placements in tournaments using both greedy heuristics and 
stochastic modeling. We simulated that if they had used stochastic modeling, they would have beaten 
Harvard in October of 2024. Maybe the team got their hands on this paper when they won the national
championship ;)
